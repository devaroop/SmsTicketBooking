Movie ticket booking
======================

Mr Famous has started a new single screen movie theater. Maximum 50 people can watch a show at a time, Mr Famous has decided to run 3 shows in a day(11am, 3pm and 8pm),
Mr Famous has decided to build a software system which will take the bookings directly from the customers using the SMS service.
Mr Famous wants below features -
- No duplicate bookings
- Same booked seat can't be booked again for a show
- No overbooking
- Allocate consecutive seats for family/groups, when booked together.
- Give the booking acknowledgment
- You can be very creative about SMS format, it has to be very easy and intuitive to use

Out of scope -
- Payment will be handled off line(out of the system)
